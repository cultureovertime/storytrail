                    <h3>A Proper Name?</h3>Before the drink, some people did have a last name of Moxie.
                    And some people had it as a nickname.

                    <h3>1876: Moxie Tonic Created</h3>.
                    Dr. Augustin Thompson, the inventor of Moxie, 
                    claimed it was made from a South American root by a "Lieutenant Moxie", who was widely considered to be made up.

                    <h3>1887: What's That Spike?</h3>
                    Starting in 1886, there is a spike of "moxie" mentions for several years.<br />
                    <img class="img-responsive" src="http://storytrail.org/demos/soda/moxieSpike.png" /><br />
                    What happened? Well, 1886 was the year Coca-Cola was introduced. Could
                    it be that people started discussing sodas and their rivalries? Or is our
                    search picking up a lot of Moxie advertising to counter the Coca-Cola threat?

                    <h3>1897: Self-promotion</h3>
                    A PR flack writes a puff piece in The National saying "[t]he echo of 'You've got a Moxie Nerve' is a part of American history. It is an expression that indicates the spirit of the times."

                    <h3>1900: Nicknames On The Rise</h3>
                    At the turn of the century, we see many cases of "Moxie" as a male nickname.
                    One tragic example is <a target="_blank" href="http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85066387/1900-08-26/ed-1/seq-40/#words=Moxie+moxie+MOXIE">Moxie Rosenberg</a>, a San Francisco boy burned in a house fire.<br />
                    <a target="_blank" href="http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85066387/1900-08-26/ed-1/seq-40/#words=Moxie+moxie+MOXIE"><center><img src="http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85066387/1900-08-26/ed-1/seq-40/thumbnail.jpg" height="90" /></center></a>
                    Today, by contrast, "Moxie" is <a target="_blank" href="http://rhiever.github.io/baby-name-explorer/index.html?BabyName=moxie">starting to be used</a> as a given name for girls, though not for boys.
                    <hr />
                <div onclick="handleNuggetClick(5)" class="page-section" id="nuggetId4"  >
                    <h3>1908: Becoming A Catchphrase</h3>
                    More of the "moxie" mentions at this time are about attitude than about the drink.
